Adds widgets that let you display subscribe links to RSS readers such as Google Reader.


== Description ==

The Subscribe Me plugin will add buttons that let your visitors share your content on [social media sites](http://www.semiologic.com/resources/blogging/help-with-feeds/) such as Bloglines or Google Reader.

Hovering the big RSS buttons will reveal the subscription services. Only major services are included, alongside a Desktop subscription link for those who have the relevant software.

Users of themes that do not support widgets will need to add the following call in their template:

    <php the_subscribe_links(); ?>

The call accepts an optional argument, which sets the widget's title.
